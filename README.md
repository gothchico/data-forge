## usage

### running simulations

to try out a simulation of the platform, run:

```bash
python test/integration-test/simulation.py
```

this will generate some sample data, store it in the data lake, add it to the catalog, and run a few transformations and analyses using the main components.

### running unit tests

you can run the unit tests to check that everythingâ€™s working as expected:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s test/unit-test
```

for more detailed output for each test, use:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s test/unit-test -v
```
